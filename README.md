## 🏢Goodcabs Company Overview
GoodCabs, an imaginary company established two years ago, has quickly become a leading cab service provider in India's tier-II cities. Unlike traditional competitors, GoodCabs is driven by a mission to
empower local drivers, helping them build sustainable livelihoods within their communities while providing passengers with exceptional service. Operating across 10 tier-II cities, GoodCabs combines a 
-focused approach with a commitment to delivering a seamless travel experience. It aims to solidify its position as a trusted mobility partner in underserved markets


## 🔎Problem Statement
Goodcabs has been operating in tier-II cities for two years, but it is still far from reaching its market penetration goals. Despite establishing a solid presence in these areas, the company is struggling to meet its ambitious 2024 targets.
To overcome this challenge, Goodcabs needs an in-depth analysis of key performance metrics. This analysis will help identify critical growth opportunities and resolve operational inefficiencies that are hindering progress.

## 🎯 Project Objective
The objective of this project is to conduct a comprehensive analysis of Goodcabs' performance across key metrics—such as trip volume, passenger satisfaction, retention rates, trip distribution, and the balance between new and repeat passengers. By evaluating these metrics, the project aims to identify critical growth opportunities, address operational inefficiencies, and provide actionable insights to help Goodcabs achieve its market penetration goals and meet its ambitious targets for 2024.
The insights from this analysis will support strategic decision-making and drive the company’s growth in tier-2 cities.

##  Data Overview
Data Sources: Analyzed data from two SQL databases and eight CSV files. Primary analysis was conducted using SQL databases, with CSV files leveraged for cross-verification and validation.

trips_db: Included key fact tables (fact_trips, fact_passenger_summary) and supporting dimension tables (dim_date, dim_city, dim_repeat_trip_distribution).

targets_db: Contained city- and month-level targets across three tables — monthly_target_trips, monthly_target_new_passengers, and city_target_passenger_rating.

# 🛠️Tools Used
Data Visualization: Tableau Public
Data Analysis: MySQL

# 🔍 Key Insights:
Jaipur generated the highest revenue (₹37.2M) but relied heavily on new passengers (80%), indicating a need for improved retention efforts.

Lucknow had a high trip volume but underperformed in revenue due to poor passenger ratings and low fare per trip.

Mysore surpassed trip targets by 20% and maintained strong customer satisfaction (ratings > 8.0).

Surat achieved the highest repeat passenger rate (42%), despite offering lower fares, showing strong brand loyalty.

# 💡 Recommendations:
Boost retention in high-revenue cities like Jaipur through loyalty programs, incentives, or engagement campaigns.

In Lucknow, focus on service quality improvements to raise ratings and justify fare increases.

Leverage Mysore’s strategy as a model for performance—emphasizing both volume and satisfaction.

Promote repeat rider behavior using targeted retention strategies in cities like Surat, which show potential despite pricing constraints.

Use seasonal trend analysis to optimize marketing and resource planning during off-peak months.
